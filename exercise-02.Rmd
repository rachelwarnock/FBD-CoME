# Bayesian tree inference using the fossilised birth-death process in BEAST2

In this exercise we'll estimate a time tree of bears under the fossilised birth-death (FBD) process. We'll use a [morphological matrix](data/bears_morphology_beast.nex) that comprises 62 binary characters for 18 living and fossil bears. We'll also use age information associated with our taxa, which is also included in this file. Download these files and examine the contents. The exercise is adapted from [this tutorial](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/FBD-tutorial/) written by Tracy Heath. The original contains lots of useful background information.

For this exercise create a folder called `FBD_exercise_BEAST2` (or whatever you want). 

BEAST2 uses an `xml` file as input, containing all the model specifications, including prior parameters and MCMC settings. You can create the `xml` file using the BEAST2 accessory program BEAUti.

## Packages

BEAST2 is similar to RevBayes in providing  flexible and modular options for analysing phylogenetic data in a Bayesian framework. One practical difference is the package structure used by BEAST2. There is a suite of models in the core BEAST2 program, but there are many other models available via packages that you can install using  BEAUti.

For the analysis in this tutorial we need to install the `SA` and `MM` packages, both developed by Sasha Gavryushkina. 

Open BEAUTi go to File > Manage Packages, scroll down, select the `SA` and `MM` packages and hit Install at the bottom. This should bring up a confirmation message.

Restart BEAUTi and we can begin setting up the analysis.

## Reading the data

To read in your data, simply drag your nexus file into the partitions panel. Or go to File > Import Alignment and navigate to your nexus file.

This will bring up a box that asks you to clarify what type of data you have. Select Add Morphological Data. 

This will then bring up a box that says, 'Would you like to condition on recording variable characters only (Mkv)?' Ordinarily when we collect morphological data, unlike when we sequence DNA, we don't typically collect non-variable characters. If unaccounted for, this results in a form of ascertainment bias. We can account for this using the 'v' (= variable coding) correction.
But for the moment select 'no', as this correction is more computationally expensive, and BEAST2 and RevBayes handle this in different ways.

If you successfully imported the data, your window should look like this.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-01.png")
```

## Tip dates

Move on to the Tip Dates panel and select `Use tip dates`. You might have noticed that the names in the nexus file are appended by a number. This is the age information associated with each species. BEAUti can parse this information.

Select auto-configure and then `use everything` > after last `_`. Back in the main window also make sure to select `Before the present` from the drop down menu. `Since some time in the past` is used more commonly for viruses or bacteria. 

## The tripartite model

Recall that for divergence time estimation we need three model components (the substitution, clock and tree models). You'll find these in the following BEAUti panels:

  1. The Site Model panel is for the substitution model
  2. The Clock Model panel is for the clock model
  3. The Priors panel is for the time tree model **and** all the other priors

Important note: there are many more options than the ones you'll see going through the panels in this tutorial. More options are available via other packages or you can directly edit the xml. 

## The site model

Head towards the Site Model panel. Because we're working with discrete morphological data, we're only presented with a limited set of options. 

First select `estimate` for the Substitution Rate.

We'll use the Lewis Mk model and we can add the Gamma sites model by putting the number of desired rate categories into the Gamma Category Count box -- let's use `4` categories. We also want to estimate the Shape parameter associated with this model, so select `estimate` for this too. 
The `1.0` in this box will become the starting value.

When you're done your window should look like this.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-02.png")
```

If you had molecular data or multiple partitions, more options would appear in this panel. 

## Clock model

Move onto the Clock Model panel and simply leave the Strict Clock option in place.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-02b.png")
```

## Priors

The Priors panel is where a lot of juicy choices happen. 
Here you will be presented with the tree model options, along with prior options for all the other parameters associated with the substitution and clock models.

First select the first toggle and select the `Fossilised Birth Death Model` from the drop down menu (you'll find this at the top of this list). You'll notice that this adds a bunch of extra parameters to the list. 

First let's concentrate on the options under the first toggle. 
In the Origin box put 40 - this is the starting value of this parameter and must lie within the bounds of the prior, which we'll specify in just a moment.

We'll leave all the other options as they are. Under this set up, we're parametrising the model using the diversification, turnover and sampling proportion option. We're also fixing Rho. You can leave this as 1.0, since we sample all living bears. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-03.png")
```

Now we've set up the tree model, let's move onto set up all the other priors. These are presented below the tree model toggle in alphabetical order. Remember that it's bad practice to stick with the default priors, unless you have good reason to.

First let's deal with the prior on the shape parameter used for the shape parameter in the Gamma sites model. For this we'll use an exponential distribution with $\delta$ = 1, which has a mean of $1/\delta$ = 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-04.png")
```

Select the clock rate. The default prior on this is a uniform distribution between 0 and infinity - this is obviously not a good prior for this parameter! Let's use an exponential prior with $\delta$ = 10 and a mean of $1/\delta$ = 0.1.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-05.png")
```

Next we'll define all the priors of the FBD model parameters, starting with the diversification rate. Let's use a gamma prior for this with shape and scale parameters $\alpha$ = 2.0 and $\beta$ = 0.1, resulting in a mean around 0.1.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-05b.png")
```

Then let's specify the sampling proportion and turnover parameters. These both lie between 0 and 1, so the default prior of a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 is a reasonable choice, in the absence of other information about these parameter values. Let's leave these as they are.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-07.png")
```

Now we'll specify a prior on the origin time parameter. 
We'll use the oldest bear fossil as a minimum (= 35.0) and a recent estimate for the age of carnivores as a maximum (= 55.0).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-07.png")
```

Finally, we'll create a clade constraint to monitor the age of all living bears. Click `+ Add Prior` and select MRCA (= most recent common ancestor) prior. Put the following 8 taxa on the righthand side: *Ailuropoda melanoleuca*, *Tremarctos ornatus*, *Melursus ursinus*, *Ursus arctos*, *Ursus maritimus*, *Helarctos malayanus*, *Ursus americanus*, *Ursus thibetanus*. Give the clade a label, e.g., `living_bears`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-08.png")
```

Leave the `monophyletic` box unchecked here because we don't want to enforce monophyly of this group, as there might be fossils also belonging to this clade. 
Note this is how you define nodes for specifying node calibrations in BEAUti. After defining a clade, you can then select a distribution from the drop down menu associated with your node.

## MCMC settings

Navigate to the MCMC panel to finalise the set up. Our dataset is small, so let's go with `100000` for the Chain Length. 
Leave the Store Every and Pre Burnin options as they are.

You can then use the `tracelog` and `treelog` toggles to specify the logging frequency. Let's change the logging frequency for both of these to `100`, so we end up with 10000 posterior samples. 
You can also change the output file names here. The trees file will keep the same prefix as the log file if you don't change the default `$(tree)`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("beauti-09.png")
```

## Exporting the xml

To create the input file for BEAST2 we need to export the `xml` file.
Simply go to File > Save As and navigate to where you want to save the file on your computer.

Close BEAUti for now. If you have time, you can come back and set up more analyses using the molecular data. 

## Running BEAST2

This might take a while run pretty quickly. Meanwhile, you could move on to the [Next tasks](#next).

## Evaluating the output

As before, open your `.log` file in Tracer.  
It should look something like this. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("trace-beast.png")
```

> Explore the output. Can you identify the different parameters? Has the analysis converged?

> What is the age of the most common recent ancestor of bears?

## Processing the trees files

Next let's generate a summary tree. BEAST has another accessory program called TreeAnnotator. Open this up. 
Add a burnin of 10%. From the `Target tree type` menu leave the default Maxmimum clade credibility (MCC) tree option and from the Node heights menu select `Keep target heights` (this is because a posterior with lots of uncertainty, which is expected when we have a small morphological matrix, can result in negative branch length is we choose median node ages). Next select your `.trees` file as the input and create a file name for your output (e.g., `bears_morphology_MCC.tre`). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("treeAnn.png")
```

Once you have your summary tree open it in FigTree and play around with the settings.
See if you can get something that looks like this.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%",  out.extra='style="padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("mcc_bears_fbd_beast.png")
```

> Which candiates on your tree do you think might be sampled ancestors?

> Play around with the HPD intervals using the Node Labels menu. Do you notice any a bit odd?

## Next tasks {#next}

Try adding the molecular sequence alignment that complements this dataset.
This is an alignment with 1000 sites of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase B for 10 living species. 

There's a bug in the latest version of BEAUti that makes it tricky to set up different partitions, so we're going to use a precooked xml for this purpose. You can download this [here](bears_morpho_cytb.xml) and get it running in BEAST.

> What differences do you notice in your output?
