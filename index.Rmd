\

# Choose your own adventure

These exercises focus on the use of the fossilised birth-death (FBD) process for Bayesian divergence time estimation using a dataset of living and extinct bears.

1. Dating exercise using [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) 
2. Dating exercise using [BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org/)

Click above to begin!

3. You can also use simulations to explore assumptions of the FBD process (and related birth-process models) using the [FossilSim](https://github.com/fossilsim/fossilsim)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",  out.extra='style="float:right; padding:30px"'}
